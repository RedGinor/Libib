# Cib

## Welcome

   Cib is a C utils library for Epitech Projects.
   It has a particular codding style imposed by Epitech for:
    
        •the organization of the delivery folder
        •the denomination of the identifiers
        •the overall presentation (paragraphs)
        •the local presentation (lines)
        •source files and headers
        •Makefiles

   This library will allow you to print, sort and manipulate data.

## Makefile & dir
    
   The provided Makefile will create a "includes" folder
   containing the functions headers in a "ib.h" file.
    
        •string manipulation  ------------->   "str"
        •array manipulation --------------->   "arr"
        •numbers manipulation ------------->   "num"
        •prints/displays  ----------------->   "print"
        •miscellaneous (other functions)  ->   "misc"

## gcc rules

      -I includes
      -L [lib's directory] -lib
